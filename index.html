          <p>With over 10 years of teaching experience at the University, Asst-Prof. Dr. Sergio Coronado developed a method called Speed Project Management that focuses on creating and maintaining a continous dynamic environment.</p> 

          <p>Every year, he applied it directly in his classes with great success and overly positive feedback from the students. Here's how it works.</p>

      <h2>Open scope selection</h2>
      <h4 class="subtitle">Do I find it interesting? Do I care about it?</h4>
      <p>Nothing kills your motivation more than working on something that you do not feel passionate about.
      There is no secret. You heard the <strong>"do what you love"</strong>. Well, once you do what you really like, you will discover the kind of <strong>motivation, drive and success</strong> that will propel you farer forward than any other method.</p>

      <p>That is why we allow you to <strong>work on your own project</strong>. The scope is wide open. You select what you like. <strong>We help, guide and advise you at every moment.</strong></p>
      

      <h2>With a flavor of business</h2>
      <h4 class="subtitle">Get a feel of the business. Love it</h4>

      <h2>"Flow" work assignements</h2>
      <h4 class="subtitle">Enjoy the work and commit fully.</h4>
      <p>You have your scope selected, you love it and are deeply motivated to make it happen. Now, your muscle needs to flex and results needs to be delivered. The "Flow" is the key to <strong>produce constant, sustainable and high quality results</strong>.</p>

      <p>Each week you have assignements, specific to your project. Those are not tests nor exams, but are clear goals and challenges that you will need to work on. This will create a measurable and trackable <strong>progress that will excite you</strong>, week after week.</p>

      <h2>And keeping up the rhythm</h2>
      <h4 class="subtitle">Weekly follow-up and coaching.</h4>
      <p>Every week, we meet and follow up on the progress. This is the moment to reflect on the work done, the problems found and the next steps to come. The rhythm is not about rushing things and burning out, it is about building a speed at wich you are able to make serious progress day after day, week after week and month after month.</p>

      <p>Though <strong>very personalised coaching</strong>, you will get all the required information that you need to move forward. Whether it is about ideas, algorithms, user experiences, designs, strategies, marketing, business, sales or anything else, <strong>we got your back!</strong></p>
